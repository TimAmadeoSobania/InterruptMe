# InterruptMe

Let your browsing exprience be interrupted a lot. Why you ask? Let me explain:

## What is this project about?
I work with the internet a lot. I also tend to get distracted easily while doing this. I happen to be on Youtube or Reddit way more then reading useful articles on Medium for example.

In the real world I try to make it as *easy* as possible to do the things I want to do more and simultaneously make it *harder* to do the things I don't want to do. For instance I place my guitar prominently in the room so it's always just a grab away. I also put the chocolate in in a cabinet in the back of my living room.

Setting or removing those kinds of barriers is not as easy while browsing because you don't have to move anyway. So this browser extension will make it harder to access some sites by **interrupting you for a period of time** while suggesting you to visit others.

## Technologies
This Project is a browser extension so it is written in **JavaScript**. It also runs **HTML**. The manifest version is 3.

## How to launch this?
As this project is not published in a browser store yet it can be cloned and then set up in Chrome as follows:
1. Open the [extensions](chrome://extensions) (chrome://extensions/).
2. Activate the 'Developer mode' in the upper right corner.
3. Click on 'Load unpacked'.
4. Open the cloned repository.

I have not tried how and if it works in other browsers.

## What else?
I am just starting to write browser extensions. If you have any tips, suggestions, questions or any other type of input feel free to contact me.
